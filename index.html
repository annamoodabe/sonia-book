  <h1></h1>
  Red and Yellow, <br>
  Round they go.<br>
  Circles and dancing<br>
  How entrancing!<br>
  Green and Blue, the planets trace<br>
  Their rotating paths through space<br>

  Harsh Moustache and slithering snakes? That is simply frightful!<br>
  Sticking worms and ocean waves? Thats much more delightful!<br>
  Coloured curves<br>
  And oblongs make<br>
  A magic carpet or mosaic.<br>
  Nestled, shining,<br>
  Near the middle,<br>
  A rare black marble- what a riddle!<br>

  Join me for a treasure hunt<br>
  In Africa’s wild continent.<br>
  Searching for the crocodile -<br>
  Can you see his eyes and smile?<br>
  And those other wriggling shapes,<br>
  Do you think they might be snakes?<br>

  Purple moon and its eclipse,<br>
  Yellow sun<br>
  And chalky cliffs…<br>
  What a thrill it is to fly<br>
  In this plane,<br>
  Across the sky!<br>
  Round the red<br>
  Propeller races.,<br>
  Taking us<br>
  To far-off places<br>

  Don’t these planets in suspension<br>
  Catch your eye and your attention?<br>
  What a journey - it’s been fantastic<br>
  And, thanks to Sonia Delaunay,<br>
  So artistic!<br>
